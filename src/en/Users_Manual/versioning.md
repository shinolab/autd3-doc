# Versioning

AUTD3 follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) starting from v8.2.0.

The version of the AUTD3 SDK is represented as vX.Y.Z.

- X represents the major version, and compatibility is not guaranteed between SDKs with different major versions.
- Y represents the minor version, which is incremented when backward-compatible features are added.
- Z represents the patch version, which is incremented when backward-compatible bug fixes are made.

## Firmware Version

The firmware version is also represented as vX.Y.Z and follows Semantic Versioning.

However, the firmware version is different from the software version.

Refer to the [release notes](./release_notes.md) for the compatibility table between firmware and software versions.
